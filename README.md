# ChSDLEngine

## What is this?
this is an C++ Custom Game or Game Engine project for learning essantials of Game Development and Architecture. 
and hopefully a tool that I can use for some of my games. 

## What are there under the hood?
This wannabe engine uses these Code Libraries right now.

* ### SDL
* SDL2 (v2.32.10)
* SDL2_mixer (v2.8.1)
* SDL2_image (v2.8.6)
* SDL2_ttf (v2.24.10)
  
* ### for Physics
* Box2d

## Whats the goal 
* Building foundations -even flawed ones- until a better understanding of Game and Game Engine Development (then probably redo-it again).
* Learning a better portion of C++ and manual memory managment.
* Developing games using this custom built engine and got a better grasp at game development or immediate systems.

Right now I am trying to learn Opengl I may update and refactor it.
